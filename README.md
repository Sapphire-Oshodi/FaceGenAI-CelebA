# 🎭 GenFace - A Face-Generating GAN
![About Image](download.png)

**GenFace** is a cutting-edge **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** designed to generate realistic human faces. The model consists of a **Generator** that creates synthetic faces and a **Discriminator** that differentiates between real and generated images. 🤖✨

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 **GAN-Powered Face Generation**: Implements deep learning techniques to synthesize realistic faces.
- ⚡ **Customizable Training**: Modify parameters to fine-tune the model’s performance.
- 📊 **Training Progress Visualization**: Monitor Generator and Discriminator loss graphs.
- 💾 **Model Checkpoints**: Save and reload trained models with ease.
- 🎨 **Synthetic Face Creation**: Generate high-quality human-like faces from noise input.

## 🛠 Installation
Clone the repository and set up the environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sapphire-Oshodi/FaceGenAI-CelebA.git
cd GenFace
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ **Train the Model**
```python
python train.py
```
2️⃣ **Generate Faces**
```python
python generator.py
```
3️⃣ **Evaluate Model Performance**
- Analyze loss curves for Generator & Discriminator balance.
- Inspect generated images visually.

---

## 📉 Model Evaluation
- 🔹 **Discriminator Loss**: Should stabilize over time.
- 🔹 **Generator Loss**: Measures how realistic the synthetic faces appear.
- 🔹 **Generated Samples**: Compare AI-generated faces with real ones.
